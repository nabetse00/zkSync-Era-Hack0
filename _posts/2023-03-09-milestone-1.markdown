# Intro

As an intermediate developer, I've recently been learning a lot about Zksync Era and its potential for revolutionizing the blockchain space. Zksync Era is a layer-2 scaling solution that allows for faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network.

I've had the opportunity to participate in a hackathon Zksync Era, and it's been an incredible learning experience. 

Through the hackathon, I've been able to explore the capabilities of Zksync Era and its potential use cases.

# Goals 

On this blog, I'll be sharing my journey as I continue to learn and develop on the Zksync Era platform. I'll be discussing topics such as how to set up a Zksync Era
and how to interact with the Zksync Era network. I'll also be sharing my thoughts on the future of Zksync Era and how it could potentially change the way we think about blockchain technology.

My hope is that this blog will be a resource for other developers who are interested in learning more about Zksync Era and how it can be used to create innovative blockchain applications. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, I invite you to join me on this journey and explore the exciting possibilities of the Zksync Era era blockchain.
